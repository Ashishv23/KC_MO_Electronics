                          <span>Fast Honest Reliable Service</span> Ill never call anyone else for my electrical or computer needs. After having geek squad in my home 4 times. Every time they would claim they fixed the issue but within a few days the problem would come back. One call to KC MO Electric and they not only fixed it but it was fixed within 24hrs. A week later I called because I had an outlet that would only work 25% of the time. They came out within 24hrs and had it fixed within an hour. I cant believe they're a family owned electric company but that explains why their prices were fair. Thank you KC MO Electric for taking such great care of me.
